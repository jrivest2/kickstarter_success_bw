            ## Insights

            I learned a lot during this build. One of the biggest things was about what a JSON file is and how we can use the JSON
            to do many cool things. A json is a really simple way to store data for later use, it is a dictionary of dictionaries
            you can kind of think of a json as a tiny SQL database that you can access using the right keys to grab a single row or
            observation. Whats really cool is how well JavaScript can use the JSON to their advantage to do other things.

            Something else I learned about was the methods and algorithms used to make the predictions possible. I could not understand
            vectorization at the start, but I got it eventually. It is the act of turning words into numbers and then doing stuff with those numbers
            it helps a computer understand what a written language is and how it can be used to find something such as similarity in writing
            style between two different people.

            All in all this was a good build that taught me new things, like the two mentioned above and about what a Github workflow looks like
            working with a team of people rather than just yourself. If there was one thing that I could change it would be that our group
            didn't get a team lead, so we lost the experience of having to work under someone and instead just ended up talking to eachother
            about our ideas and how to implement them.
